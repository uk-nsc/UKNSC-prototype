                Members of the public, such as patients and family who have experienced the condition, are welcome
                to submit comments. These will be reviewed by the UK NSC along with the scientific evidence and
                comments from stakeholders, charities and researchers.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                While we welcome all comments, we would prefer to get your individual thoughts rather than standard
